# Giving++

* Built a web app on Microsoft Azure at the 2019 MIT Hackathon to help people donate by web scraping for topics people care about and recent natural disasters and then linking them to related articles and charities
* Personally implemented API calls/methods to pass real-time info, articles, and charities to the backend and then worked on the adaptable frontend, getting info from the database with C# and displaying it with HTML
